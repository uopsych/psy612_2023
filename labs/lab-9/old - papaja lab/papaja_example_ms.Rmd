We could start our introduction here, potentially saying something about the history of the Big Five [@goldberg1990alternative], or about Roberts and colleagues [-@roberts2005]. We could also mention @mcclelland1993statistical.

# Methods

We report how we determined our sample size, all data exclusions (if any), all manipulations, and all measures in the study.

## Participants

We have `r nrow(psych::bfi)` participants who completed some or all of the Big Five.

## Material

## Procedure

## Data analysis

We used `r cite_r("r-references.bib")` for all our analyses.

# Results

```{r descrips-tab, results = "asis" }
b5 <- bfi %>% 
  cbind(scoreVeryFast(keys = bfi.keys, items = bfi))

descriptives <- b5 %>%
  # select the columns for agreeableness to openness
  select(agree:openness) %>% 
  # convert into long format
  gather(scale, score) %>% 
  # group_by trait
  group_by(scale) %>% 
  # calculate the mean, median, sd, min, and max for each trait
  summarize(
    Mean   = mean(score), 
    Median = median(score), 
    SD     = sd(score), 
    Min    = min(score),
    Max    = max(score))

apa_table(descriptives, 
          caption = "Descriptive statistics of Big Five Scale Scores.", 
          note    = "This table was created with apa_table().", 
          escape  = TRUE)
```

```{r scale-intercors}

(ref:fig-ageXconsc-cap) Conscientiousness by Age.

```{r fig-ageXconsc, fig.cap="(ref:fig-ageXconsc-cap)"}
ggplot(b5, aes(x = age, y = conscientious)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  labs(x = "Age",
       y = "Conscientiousness") +
  # theme_apa puts it in apa format
  theme_apa(box = TRUE)
```

We calculated scale scores for each of the Big Five. Descriptive statistics for each of the Big Five personality traits are shown in Table\ \@ref(tab:descrips-tab), where it is apparent that means were near the scale midpoints of 4.5, with the exception of neuroticism which had a much lower mean of `r printnum(mean(b5$neuroticism, na.rm = TRUE))`.

Scale inter-correlations can be found in Table\ \@ref(tab:scale-intercors-tbl), where one can see that the smallest correlation was between neuroticism and openness (*r* = `r printnum(cor$r["neuroticism","openness"])`) and the largest correlation was between extraversion and agreeableness (*r* = `r printnum(cor$r["agree","extraversion"])`).

We next examined the extent to which grand-mean centered age and education are related to conscientiousness, based on the postulates of social investment theory [@roberts2005]. The results from a model with just age and a model with age and education are shown in Table\ \@ref(tab:reg-models-tbl) below. Age had a small (but significant) positive association with conscientiousness, both when education was (`r model_2_results$full_result$age`) and was not (`r model_1_results$full_result$age`) included as a covariate. Education significantly (but modestly) improved the model fit (`r model_comp_results$full_result`). Interestingly, the pattern of results did not follow a monotonic increase from some highschool to graduate degree. In fact, the only significant difference in conscientiousness across education was between participants who didn't finish high school and participants who reported having some college (`r model_2_results$full_result$educationSome_College`). At the sample average age, participants who didn't finish highschool had an average conscientiousness score of ($M_{SomeHS}$ = `r printnum(model_2$coefficients[["(Intercept)"]])`) while participants with some college had an average conscientiousness score of ($M_{SomeCollege}$ = `r printnum(model_2$coefficients[["(Intercept)"]] + model_2$coefficients[["educationSome College"]])`). The remaining effects of education were small and non-significant (see Table\ \@ref(tab:reg-models-tbl)).

Figure\ \@ref(fig:fig-ageXconsc) depicts the small, linear increase of conscientiousness across the age range of our participants.
