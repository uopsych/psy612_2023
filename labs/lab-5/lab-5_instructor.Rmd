# Purpose

Today's lab will focus on one-way ANOVA. You can download the rmarkdown file [here](lab-5.Rmd). We will start with the traditional way like Sara did in class on Thursday. However, the majority of the lab time afterwards will focus on running an ANOVA as a linear regression with a categorical predictor. Though we haven't talked about it yet, the content will be covered in detail during next week's class.

Be sure to have the following packages loaded:

```{r, message=FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(tidyverse) # for plotting and data wrangling
library(rio) # for importing data
library(psych) # for descriptives
library(emmeans) # for t-tests
```

# Research scenario

We'll be looking at a dataset comparing different kinds of treatment for depression. In this study, depressed patients (n = 5 per group) were randomly assigned to one of three groups:

1.	CBT group 
2.	Psychotherapy group 
3.	Control group (received no therapy) 

After 10 weeks, participants' depression scores were measured (on a scale of 1 = no depression to 12 = severely depressed). Our dataset will have just 2 variables: `group` (CBT, Psychotherapy, or Control) and `depress` (depression scores). 

**NOTE:**
`1` = CBT; 
`2` = Psychotherapy;
`3` = Control

Import the data

```{r}
depression <- import("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/uopsych/psy612/master/labs/lab-5/data/depression_therapy.csv")
```

## Structure of the data

The first thing we should check is how the data are structured. We should have a factor called `group` and a numeric variable for depression scores called `depress`. Let's use the function `str()`.


```{r}
str(depression)
```

## Recode `group` as a factor

R thinks that `group` is an integer, so we need to make it into a factor in order to run our analysis. We can use `mutate()` and base R's `factor()`, which can be used to turn variables into factors.

NOTE: You want to provide labels in the same order as the levels of the factor, so in this case we want them in the order `CBT`, `Psychotherapy`, and `Control` (see above). 

```{r}
depression = depression %>% 
  mutate(group = factor(group,
                        labels = c("CBT", "Psychotherapy", "Control"))) # order matters here! 
```

Look at the structure of the data again. Now it's clear that `group` is a factor variable with the correct levels. 

```{r}
str(depression)
```

## Descriptives

Next, we'll get descriptives for each group using two tidyverse functions, `group_by()` and `summarize()`. First, you want to group by `group`, and then you want to summarize with three arguments, mean, sd, and n.

Click [here](https://uopsych.github.io/psy611/labs/lab-5.html#Summarizing_data) to see how we did it in psy611.

```{r}
depression %>% 
  group_by(group) %>% 
  summarize(mean = mean(depress, na.rm = TRUE),
            sd = sd(depress, na.rm = TRUE),
            n = n()) %>% 
  knitr::kable(digits = 2)
```


You can also get descriptives with the describeBy() function. Try adding `mat = TRUE` as an argument.

```{r}
describeBy(depression$depress, depression$group, mat = TRUE)
```

## Visualizing the data

There are many ways that you can visualize the data. In ggplot, I recommend adding a `geom_boxplot()`, or `geom_bar()`, or `geom_violin()` layer.

[This](https://www.r-graph-gallery.com/boxplot.html) is a good resource for boxplots with ggplot, [this](https://www.r-graph-gallery.com/barplot.html) is a good resource for bar plots with ggplot, and [this](https://www.r-graph-gallery.com/violin.html) is a good resource for violin plots with ggplot.

```{r}
depression %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = fct_reorder(group, depress), y = depress)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  geom_jitter() +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(x = NULL,
       y = "Average depression score",
       fill = "Group",
       title = "Depression scores per group")

depression %>% 
  group_by(group) %>% 
  summarise(avg_depress = mean(depress),
            sd = sd(depress)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = fct_reorder(group, avg_depress), 
             y = avg_depress)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity",
           fill = "cornflowerblue") +
  geom_point(data = depression, 
             aes(x = group, y = depress),
             position = 'jitter')+
  theme_minimal()+
  labs(y = "Average depression score",
       x = NULL,
       title = "Average depression score per group") +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin=avg_depress - sd, ymax=avg_depress + sd),
                width = .1)

depression %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = fct_reorder(group, depress), y = depress)) +
  geom_violin(aes(fill = group)) +
  geom_jitter() +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(x = NULL,
       y = "Average depression score",
       fill = "Group",
       title = "Depression scores per group")+
  theme(legend.position = "none") 

```

# Traditional ANOVA

We will briefly review how to generate a traditional ANOVA table.

To get an ANOVA table, you can use the same `lm()` as regression, and use `anova()` to get the ANOVA summary table. Importantly, you want to make sure that the categorical IV is a factor. 


```{r}
model_anova <- lm(depress ~ group, data = depression)
anova(model_anova)
```

To calculate pairwise comparisons between group levels, use `emmeans::emmeans()`. This function takes an `lm()` output, an equation that indicates we want to perform pairwise t-tests (`pairwise`) on the left, and the IV (`group`) on the right, as well as an `adjust` (e.g. "bonferroni" or "holm").


```{r}

emmeans(model_anova, pairwise ~ group, adjust = "none")

```

Since we are running a lot of test, we need to correct for multiple comparisons so that we don't have an inflated type I error rate.


* Bonferroni correction:multiplies the p-values by the number of comparisons.

```{r}

emmeans(model_anova, pairwise ~ group, adjust = "bonferroni")

```

* Holm correction: 
  * Rank order the p-values from largest to smallest.
  * Start with the smallest p-value. Multiply it by its rank.
  (0.000052 *3 = 0.000156)
  * Go to the next smallest p-value. Multiply it by its rank. If the result is larger than the previous step, keep it. Otherwise replace with the previous step adjusted p-value.
  (0.0034 * 2 = 0.0068)
  * Repeat Step 3 for the remaining p-values.
  (0.0286 * 1 = 0.0286)
  * Judge significance of each new p-value against Î±=.05


```{r}

emmeans(model_anova, pairwise ~ group, adjust = "holm")

```

>**Question:** What difference do you notice about the Bonferroni vs. Holm correction? 



*pause and let students answer*









Bonferroni tends to have higher p-values, which indicates it's a more conservative test. Bonferroni also leads to higher chance of type II error (not detecting the effect when there is one.)

# Regression with categorical predictors

We have just reviewed how to do generate a traditional ANOVA table. We will next talk about how to perform ANOVA within a linear regression framework. This will give us the same information we already got from our regression model, and something more!

## Dummy coding

In regression, categorical predictors with more than two levels are broken up into more than one predictor. This actually happens under the hood in R when our independent variable is a factor. Let's put `group` as the predictor in our model as before:


```{r}
model_default <- lm(depress ~ group, data = depression) 
summary(model_default)
```

>**Question:** What does the F test tell us?




*pause and let students answer*









 
 Whether any mean is different from any other mean. 

Here is our regression equation:

$$Depression_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1psychotherapy_i + 
\beta_2control_i + e_i$$

R is creating two dummy variables for us under the hood: `groupPsychotherapy` and `groupControl`.  This is what R is doing:

```{r}
depression %>%
  mutate(groupPsychotherapy = ifelse(group == "Psychotherapy", 1, 0),
         groupControl = ifelse(group == "Control", 1, 0)) 
```


By default, R treats whatever the first level of the factor variable is as the reference group. In this case, CBT was the first level of `group` (because it was initially coded as `1` in our raw data), so the model treated CBT as our reference group.

Here is our regression equation, derived from the output:

$$Depression_i = 7.20 -3.80psychotherapy + 2.60control$$

>**Question:** Determine the mean depression score of each group.




*pause and let students answer*












7.2: CBT
7.2 - 3.8 = 3.4: psychotherapy
7.2 + 2.6 = 9.8: control

can use `describeBy(depression$depress, depression$group, mat = TRUE)` to check.

Now, let's revisit the output.
```{r}
model_default <- lm(depress ~ group, data = depression) 
summary(model_default)
```
>**Question:** Interpret the intercept. What does a significant p-value signify?




*pause and let students answer*











mean of CBT is significantly different from 0.

>**Question:** Interpret the slopes. What do the significant p-values signify?





*pause and let students answer*









The differences between psychotherapy and control are significantly different from the mean of CBT.

Let's imagine that we have the following (more intuitive) research questions:

1. Is CBT effective (relative to no therapy)? 
2. Is psychotherapy effective (relative to no therapy)?  

>**Question:** What do want our reference group to be to answer these research questions?

Now let's make the appropriate dummy codes. Recall that we need *k*-1 dummy codes (where *k* is the number of groups). We have 3 groups, so we need 2 dummy codes. 

Remember, our decision of how to set the dummy codes (which group to set as the **reference group**) should be guided by our research questions. 


### Method 1: Create dummy variables with `mutate()`

```{r}
# create new dummy variables containing 1's and 0's
depression <- depression %>%
  mutate(CBT.v.Control = 
           ifelse(group == "CBT", 1, 0), 
         Psychotherapy.v.Control = 
           ifelse(group == "Psychotherapy", 1, 0)) 

depression
```

Now, we can run the linear model using these new dummy variables as the IV's.


```{r}
model_dummy1 <- lm(depress ~ CBT.v.Control + Psychotherapy.v.Control, data = depression) 
summary(model_dummy1)
```

>**Question:** What does the intercept mean? What do the slopes mean?



*pause and let students answer*








mean of the control group; slopes are the differences from the control group.

### Method 2: Contrast Matrix

Now we're going use another method to create our dummy codes by creating a contrast matrix. When we pass a factor to `lm()` it uses a contrast matrix under the hood. Although R creates the contrast matrix automatically with certain default assumptions, you can set it yourself if you have a specific set of codes in mind (which we do).

Use `contrasts()` to view the default contrast matrix associated with our grouping variable.

```{r}
contrasts(depression$group)  
```

Again, by default our contrasts are not how we want them because we want `Control` to be the reference group. To manually specify our dummy codes, we'll use the function `contr.treatment()`, which will return a contrast matrix with specific characteristics, depending on what we tell it. The first argument, `n` is the number of levels of the factor variable. The second argument, `base` refers to the level of the factor that should be considered the reference group.

```{r}
contr.treatment(n = 3, base = 3)    
```

We can now overwrite the default contrast matrix for `group` with the one we just manually specified.

```{r lab-5-27}
contrasts(depression$group) <- contr.treatment(n = 3, base = 3)    
```


* Now look at the structure of the data again. What do you notice about `group`?


```{r}
str(depression)
```

Let's take a closer look at `group` using `attributes()`...

```{r}
attributes(depression$group)
```


Now, run the linear model with `group` (now containing our desired dummy codes) as the IV.

```{r}
model_dummy2 <- lm(depress ~ group, data = depression) 
summary(model_dummy2)
```

### Method 3: Re-order levels of your factor

Let's take another look at the levels of `group`

```{r}
levels(depression$group)
```

We can manually change the order of the levels by using `factor()` and manually specifying the `levels` argument to contain the order we want. Again, since R treats the first level of the factor as the reference group, and we want `Control` to be the reference group in order to obtain our contrasts of interests when we run the linear model, we will create a new version of `group` called `group_relevel` and make `Control` the first level of the factor in this new variable.

```{r}
depression <- depression %>% 
  mutate(group_relevel = factor(group, levels = c("Control",
                                                  "CBT",
                                                  "Psychotherapy"))) 
```

To double check that this worked, let's look at the levels of `group_relevel`


```{r}
levels(depression$group_relevel)
```

Now when we run the linear model, the contrast matrix that will be automatically generated will correspond to the correct contrasts we want. To verify this, let's re-run the linear model (yet again!) with the re-leveled `group_relevel` variable as the IV. 

```{r}
model_dummy3 <- lm(depress ~ group_relevel, data = depression) 
summary(model_dummy3)
```

## Other coding schemes

There are many other coding schemes besides dummy coding, such as and **deviation coding** (also known as "effects coding"), which can compare individual group means to the overall mean of the dependent variable (i.e. the grand mean). You can read more about that [here](https://stats.idre.ucla.edu/r/library/r-library-contrast-coding-systems-for-categorical-variables/){target="_blank"}.

# Minihacks{#minihacks}

Research Problem: 

You are interested in the effectiveness of a new drug in treating the symptoms of depression. You randomly assign patients with depression into one of 3 treatment groups with different levels of the drug (low, medium, and high), and also one control group that only received a placebo. You then measure their symptoms after 4 weeks of drug treatment. You are interested in whether the drug is effective, and what level of the drug is most effective.

* Load in the raw data with the following code

```{r lab-5-57}
depression_drug <- import("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/uopsych/psy612/master/labs/lab-5/data/depression_drug.csv")
```

## Minihack 1

Recreate the following table.


```{r}
depression_drug <- depression_drug %>% 
  mutate(drug = factor(drug, 
                       levels = c("none", "low", "medium", "high")))

depression_drug %>% 
  group_by(drug) %>%
  summarize(mean = mean(depression, na.rm = TRUE),
            sd = sd(depression, na.rm = TRUE),
            n = n()) %>% 
  knitr::kable(digits = 2) 
```

![](images/depression_table.png)
<br> 

Recreate the following boxplot.

![](images/depression_boxplot.png)

What pattern do you notice in the data? 

```{r}
depression_drug %>% 
  ggplot(aes(drug, depression)) + 
  geom_boxplot() + 
  theme_minimal() + 
  labs(x = "Drug", y = "Depression")
```

***

## Minihack 2

* Run an omnibus ANOVA test to determine whether there is a relationship between `drug` and `depression`. What does this tell you? 

```{r}
anova_drug <- lm(depression ~ drug, data = depression_drug)
anova(anova_drug)
```

At least one group was different than another group in depression level.

* Using your preferred method of dummy coding, test whether there is a significant difference between depression scores for each drug group (`low`, `medium`, `high`) and the `none` group. Interpret all model coefficients.

```{r}

contrasts(depression_drug$drug) <- contr.treatment(n = 4, base = 1)  

model_drug <- lm(depression ~ drug, data  = depression_drug)
summary(model_drug)
```

***

## Minihack 3

* Conduct pairwise comparisons for `depression` scores across all levels of `drug`. Use a correction method to account for multiple comparisons. 

```{r}

emmeans(model_drug, pairwise ~ drug, adjust = "bonferroni")

emmeans(model_drug, pairwise ~ drug, adjust = "holm")

```
