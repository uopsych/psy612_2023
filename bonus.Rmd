This page contains links to journal articles, blog posts, webpages, etc., that we (the instructors) believe may be useful to you, or at the very least interesting. **Bold** articles are ones that we consider **must-reads** but don't have enough time to actually assign. And to be clear, must-read means that people will probably assume you've read this and know the basic points.

  - The spectrum of behavioral sciences
  
[Chapter 2. **Bivariate Correlation and Regression.**](readings/CCWA_ch2.pdf) 
  - Tabular and graphic representations of relationships
  - The index of linear correlation between two variables
  - The Pearson Product-Moment Correlation Coefficient
  - Alternative formulas
  - Regression coefficients
  - Regression toward the mean
  - The standard error of the estimate and measures of the strength of association

## On coding and data science

Peters (2004) ["The Zen of Python."](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/) -- A list of 19 principles for writing better Python code; the principles also apply to writing better R code. 

Hill (2019) ["Meet xaringan."](https://arm.rbind.io/slides/xaringan.html#1) -- There are a ton of resources for learning how to make slides using R. Too many to list here. I like this one because it's accessible, funny, visually appealing, and will help you make slides that you're proud of. (By the way, UO has theme you can use.)

Bryan (2019) ["Happy Git with R."](https://happygitwithr.com) -- Interested in using GitHub for version control? Jenny Bryan will guide you through the process and metaphorically hand you a tissue when you're screaming with frustration.

Anderson (2021) ["Social Data Science with R"](https://www.sds.pub/index.html) -- This book is currently being developed for the data science sequence at the University of Oregon, taught in the education department by Daniel Anderson. It is a helpful resource for foundational coding skills and data visualization in R. 

Robinson (2016) [Broom: Converting Statistical Models to Tidy Data Frames](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VGPUBWGv6g) -- This YouTube video explains how to use the `{Broom}` package to extract useful information from model objects. 

## On creating useful graphics

Patil (2020) ["ggstatsplot"](https://indrajeetpatil.github.io/ggstatsplot/index.html) -- A very useful R package for creating visuals to display some basic univariate and bivariate descriptives. 

## On statistical models

[YouTube series on linear algebra](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab)

[PSY 611](https://uopsych.github.io/psy611/) -- Don't forget everything we covered last term!

Dunn & Smyth (2019) [Generalized Linear Models With Examples in R](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4419-0118-7) -- if you're looking for a supplemental (free, online) textbook to cover general and generalized linear models, I highly recommend this one. It includes useful tidbits, like [coding factors](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4419-0118-7_1#Sec4), an expansion on the [matrix algebra notation](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4419-0118-7_2#Sec13) for multiple regression, and an extended section on the [R code](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4419-0118-7_2#Sec39) useful for linear models. Plus, it expands to cases we don't cover in class. 

Gelman posted a document containing [Tips for improving regression](https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/raos_tips.pdf) on his blog, but I can't find the original citation. It may be from one of his own works or from someone else's. Let me know if you figure it out!
